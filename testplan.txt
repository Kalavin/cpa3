SETUP:
Step 1: Connect to clamshell in multiple windows. (One for the server and 1+ for the client(s))
Step 2: Type "make" in each window to compile the server and client.
Step 3: Designate a window for the server and type "./server 5858"
Step 3(cont): 5858 represents the port number. You can choose any port number you'd like over 3000 if you'd like.
Step 4: In each client window you have open, type "./client clamshell.rutgers.edu 5858"
Step 4(cont): Once again any port number over 3000 works but make sure it matches the one used for the server.
Step 5: Start using commands!
